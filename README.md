# Spotify-clone

<p align =" justify"> As part of my journey in learning web development, I created a basic Spotify clone using only HTML and CSS. This project was aimed at showcasing my front-end development skills, particularly in designing and styling user interfaces. The clone is responsive and visually replicates the layout and design of the original Spotify interface. Although it doesnâ€™t include functional audio playback (as it was built without JavaScript), it effectively demonstrates my ability to structure content and apply styling to create a user-friendly and modern-looking web page. </p>

# Features-

- Visually styled play/pause and next/previous buttons (non-functional, for UI demonstration only)
- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- Styled progress bar and track info section
- Display of a currently "playing" song layout with album artwork and song details (static)

# Usage
Open the Spotify clone in your browser to explore the user interface. You can view the song list, see the styled player controls at the bottom, and observe how the layout adjusts to different screen sizes. While playback functionality isn't included, the design closely resembles the original Spotify interface.
